# Air Purifer

Welcome to the DIY Air Purifier project! Here, I'm sharing my journey of making an affordable air purifier from scratch. I couldn't find budget-friendly options, so I decided to create my own.

## What's the story?
I wanted clean air for the grow room where I'm keeping my hydroponic farm (not weed). Things got a bit plant-smelly during the summer, and I realized I needed to filter the air to remove both the particles and the smell. But the air purifiers sold in stores were way too expensive. So, I thought, 'Why not build one myself?' I realized it's just a fan and a special filter working together. Simple, right?

## My Goals
* Upskill as an Engineer
* Affordable
* Efficient & Effective
* IoT Enabled
* Simple!

## How do air purifiers work?
* Push or Pull polluted air using a fan 
* Force the air through a filter, idealy HEPA (for dust) & Activated Carbon (for smell) filters
* Circulate air in the room so it doesn't keep filtering clean air

## My Approach
* Find a suitable filter. Air purifiers are expensive but their replacement filters are cheap so I will utilise them
* Create a fan from scratch using 3D printed parts and a brushless motor (quiet one)
* Mount the fan to the filter
* Develop an embedded system to control the fan speed and send air quality info to my home automation system
* Test

## Filter
I've decided to use Sunbeam Fresh Protect Air Purifier Filter (NZD$35)for this project! \
It uses a 3 stage filtration system (pre-filter, True HEPA filter, and carbon filter), exactly what I need! P.S, The air purifer that uses this filter costs NZD$300!
